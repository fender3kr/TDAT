# TDAT
<h3>Data Annotation Tool for Tensorflow Analysis (TDAT)</h3>

<H4>Description</H4>
Tnesorflow object detection requires annotated datasets represented in RFRecord format. Existing tools such as [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) and [VoTT](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT) support data annotation but they do not support satellite images in GeoTIFF, which is one of frequently used raster data formats in geo-analysis. TDAT supports object annotation, being plugged into [QGIS](https://qgis.org/ko/site/), a popular GIS application.
